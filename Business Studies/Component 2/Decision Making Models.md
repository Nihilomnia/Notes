## Critical Path Analysis 

// This is basically the exact same as Further Maths (Decision) so yeah..... (And Yes I do it but there was no need to add its notes to this vault ..well i might actually) 

CPA is a project analysis and planning method that allows a project to be completed in the shortest possible time 

Critical path analysis helps to decide which activities can be completed at the same time (simultaneously) and which activities must be completed first before a new take can begin.

Understanding this helps to make the most efficient use of time and resources.

It also helps to identify the shortest time that a project is able to be completed within.

This is a critical path diagram 

the black number indicates the number of the node and the blue number indicates the  latest finish time (LFT) , Red number indicate the  Earliest Staring Time (EST)

here is a better diagram

### Nodes 

Every critical path diagram follows the simple rule of starting and ending upon a single node.

A node is a circle that shows the earliest start time (EST) that a new task can begin and the latest finish time (LFT) that a previous task can end without delaying next task.


### Activities 

Activities are shown by lines and arrows.

The length of the line  doesn't matter at all so just ignore it.

They often have a letter assigned to it to keep track of it.

for example

### Simultaneous Activities 

When more than one activity can start at the start time we call them simultaneous activities.

This looks like the example given below:

### Dependent Activities 

This is when activity cannot start until another one has been completed.

This looks like the example below:

### Precedent Tables 

These are tables that outline the activity that needs to be completed, any activities that precede them and the duration of each individual activity.

They look like this 


| Activity | Preceded By: | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| A        | -            | 4        |
| B        | A            | 6        |
| C        | -            | 11       |
| D        | B,C          | 3        |
| E        | D            | 1        |
| F        | E            | 5        |


The respective diagram would look like this

### The Forwards Pass


A pass through the network diagram is used to help us calculate the earliest start time (EST) for each activity.

We move left to right through the network and start at the far left with the first node.

The EST for this node MUST be zero given that no other activity has began as yet.

We then move to the node. So for node number 2 we add the zero for the EST of node 1 to the time it takes for activity A to be completed.

This means that the EST value for node 2 is 4. i.e.  0 + 4 = 4


### The Backwards Pass

A backwards pass through the network diagram is used to help us calculate the latest finish time (LFT) for each activity.

We move right to left through the network and start at the far right with the last node which in our example is node 6.

The LFT for this node MUST be the same value value as its EST given that no other activity follows on from the last node.

We then move to the next node. So for node number 5 we subtract the time it takes for activity F to be completed from the LFT for node 6.

This means that the LFT value for node 5 is 15. i.e 20 -5 = 15


### Float time

You might have noticed that in our example, the EST and LFT values for node 2 were different.

This difference is what is called float.

This means that  it is possible for some delay to occur in activity A without the entire project being delayed.

The Tech for this is 

$$
Bottom - Middle - Top
$$

Also if the float is 0 that means that any delay to that activity would delay the whole project 

Also another Tech for this  is that for example there was an Activity called A  with a float of 5 days 

if A was delayed for 6 days  we can use this formula 
$$
Float - Delay = Addtion to Time Taken for project
$$

this  if the number is negative that means we add its Abs to the project time  if it positive its just the remaining float time


in this case it would be  5 -6 = -1  that means that because of A being delayed the whole project would be delayed


### Usefulness of Float Time 

Knowledge of float time allows managers in charge of the project's management to allocate resources more efficiently

Managers might be able to take resources away from a particular activity which has some float to allow them to complete a more critical activity earlier.

An example might be reallocating labour or machinery.

This might help provide a company with a competitive advantage as the project is completed ahead of schedule.


### Critical Activities 

Any activity which has an EST and LFT of the same value is considered to be critical.

This means that any delay in this activity will cause a delay to the entire project and this can be expensive.

Managers need to prioritize the completion of these activities and to ensure that the resources are available when needed.


### The Critical Path 

In our example, identify which activities have the same EST and LFT values and are therefore critcal.



 











## Cost benefit Analysis

Cost Benefit Analysis in not an exact process - it is more art than judgement.

**This provides students with an easy way to score marks for Evaluation -   you need to judge the effectiveness of the CBA  process !!!**

Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is a method for measuring in financial terms, the costs and benefits of an investment.

It includes a consideration of the
